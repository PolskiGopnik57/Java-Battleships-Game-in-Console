# Java-Battleships-Game-in-Console
A complex Java Battleships Game, consisting of a smart bot, and coded by me in about 20-30 hours (my first game in Java, 2nd program in java)
If this gets enough, or any downloads at all and anyone is curious about how i made which part, or how the bot works as its quite hard to understand from the source code alone (im Polish so some variables are in Polish), i can edit this file and explain how the bot works :). It took a long time to code for such a simple game, but it was an interesting experience, and im very proud of what ive created.
